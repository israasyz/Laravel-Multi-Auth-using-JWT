# Laravel Multiple Authentication using Guards and JWT

This repository is part of a Hospital Management System Project where we have three main users: admins, patients and doctors. The code authenticate and authorize each different user to his/her routes and resources. Laravel Guards were used as there was three distinct tables. I used [jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth/tree/develop) library for JWT authentication.
